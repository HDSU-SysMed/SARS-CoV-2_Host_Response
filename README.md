# Dynamics-SARS-COV-2-Host-Cell
In this study, we assessed the sequence and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 host cell interactions inferred from transcriptome analyses. You can find scripts for data preprocessing, evaluations, model simulations and creation of figures. Transcriptomic data are available via the following link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE217504.
